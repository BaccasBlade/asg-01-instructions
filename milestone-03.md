# Assignment 01 - Milestone 03

## <span style="color: red">WARNING</span>

**THIS MILESTONE IS NOT YET COMPLETE, AT LEAST AS OF 2021-09-04.  
I WILL REMOVE THIS WARNING WHEN IT IS GOOD TO GO.**

---

**Due October 27 (W) @ 9 PM**

**PLEASE:** Since this is your final product, please just put this in your main branch. If you have any questions on how to do this, you know what to do.

## Overview

This is actually your final product...does that count as a milestone?!? I guess so?

There are a lot of checkboxes below. It's a big assignment.

## Your Mark

This is different from your first 2 milestones. Nature of the beast, you know.

- if you meet all of the Standard Requirements below, that's worth a B
- if you are missing **one** of the requirements below, that's worth a C
- if you are missing **two** of the requirements below, that's worth a D
- if you are missing **three or more** of the requirements below, but at least submit _something_ that's partially working, that's worth an F+
- if you don't submit anything, that's worth an F

### What about an A?!?

Oh yeah - thanks for the reminder.  
You'll get an A if you've completed all the Standard Requirements **and** have completed 2 of the Exemplary Requirements as well.

### What about the plusses, like B+?

There aren't any.

## Requirements

### Standard Requirements

### Exemplary Requirements

To get an A, the submitted work must fufill two additional requirements:

The first is this requirement:

- [ ] the code is well-designed and expressive. This is kind of vague, so here's some guidance:

  - did you modularize your code with functions?
  - are your functions well-named, small and cohesive?
  - is code duplication low?
  - are your variables and constants expressively named?
  - is appropriate documentation present?
  - is the code mainly yours, or largely Frankenstein'd together from code you found online?

IN ADDITION, the submitted work must fufill **one** of these requirements:

- [ ] the page incorporates another external API that's applicable to the page topic (weather? Covid case counts?) and presented in a useful manner

- [ ] the page incorporates design principles from refactoring.ui and Randy's Web Visual Design 2020 slides. You will demonstrate this by submitting a document that uses annotated screencaps that call out the principles followed.

- [ ] the page provides an improved user experience in two substantial ways. You must clear your ideas with JP before going ahead with them, because _your_ "substantial" and _mine_ might be substantially (ahem) different....
